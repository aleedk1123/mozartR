# Markov Chain Music Composer

Whether computer can achieve creativity comparable to the level which we can accept as artistic creation has arose many interests, since machine learning was introduced. Computer composing music is perhaps even more enticing, considering that music pervades our daily lives. Music is a medium that is particularly well suited to such study, in contrast to painting or writing, because we can capture music in a score that can be formalized into a machine representation. In this project, I tried to build a model which compose music that learns from Mozart's Minuet k1 using R and Python.
